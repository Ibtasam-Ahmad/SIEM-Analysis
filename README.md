# SIEM-Analysis (Fraud & Intrusion Detection with Machine Learning and Deep Learning)

## üìå Overview

This repository brings together multiple projects focused on **fraud detection** and **intrusion detection systems (IDS)** using **machine learning (ML)** and **deep learning (DL)** techniques. The work leverages benchmark datasets (such as **KDDTest+**) and financial transaction data to explore classification, anomaly detection, and predictive modeling.

The repository contains Jupyter notebooks, sample code, and datasets to demonstrate end-to-end workflows: from **data preprocessing** to **model training, evaluation, and visualization**.

## üìÇ Project Structure

* **`fraud-detection.ipynb`**
  A notebook focusing on detecting fraudulent financial transactions using ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost). Includes preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

* **`financial-fraud-detection.ipynb`**
  A more advanced fraud detection notebook, emphasizing **imbalanced data handling** techniques (SMOTE, undersampling, oversampling), cost-sensitive learning, and performance comparisons.

* **`intrusion-detection-system-with-ml-dl.ipynb`**
  Implements an **IDS pipeline** using both ML algorithms (Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, etc.) and DL architectures (ANN, CNN, LSTM). Uses the **KDD Cup 1999** and **NSL-KDD** datasets to classify normal vs. attack traffic.

* **`KDDTest+.csv`**
  A subset of the **NSL-KDD dataset**, commonly used for IDS research. It contains labeled network traffic records for evaluating ML/DL intrusion detection models.

* **`code.ipynb`**
  A general-purpose notebook containing helper functions, shared utilities, and experimental runs for preprocessing, training, and visualization.
